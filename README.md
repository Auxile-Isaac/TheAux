What is TheAux?

TheAux is a Telehealth which is the use of communications technologies to provide health care from a distance. These technologies may include computers, cameras, videoconferencing, the Internet, and satellite and wireless communications. Some examples of telehealth include:

A "virtual visit" with a health care provider, through a phone call or video chat
Remote patient monitoring, which lets your provider check on you while you are at home. For example, you might wear a device that measures your heart rate and sends that information to your provider.
A surgeon using robotic technology to do surgery from a different location
Sensors that can alert caregivers if a person with dementia leaves the house
Sending your provider a message through your electronic health record (EHR)
Watching an online video that your provider sent you about how to use an inhaler
Getting an email, phone, or text reminder that it's time for a cancer screening
